# DM Scribe #
  > A tool for DMs to help streamline the game by automatically keeping track of turn order during combat encounters.

## Summary ##
  > Our product allows a DM to add visually appealing player and monster cards to the webpage that display the most important stats for combat and automatically generates the turn order. The initiative roll can be manually inputted or automatically rolled for both players and monsters depending on the players and DMs preference.

## Problem ##
  > Typically keeping track of turn order in a combat encounter with many players and monsters can be burdensome, often involving whiteboards or many pieces of scratch paper that can get disorganized and confusing.

## Solution ##
  > With our product, once players are added the board, adding monsters will automatically generate turn order and keep track of it for you at the bottom of the screen.
  > A DM may enter his players once and save them for future use. Once players are added keeping track of combat is as simple as searching for the monster in the search bar and adding it to the board. A DM may check the boxes for auto-rolling turn order for both monsters and players. The turn order is automatically generated everytime a monster is added to the board. Monsters can be removed from the board as they are defeated in combat, which updates the turn order accordingly.
